The idea of the project is a recommendation system for electronic devices. The user can make different search queries to find what he/she is looking for. Some examples for the electronic devices are mobile phones, laptops, smart witches, smart screens, and tables. The user has the following operations to do in order to find his suitable electronic device:
1.	Choose a category and get recommended devices from the chosen category.
2.	Add maximum price to the search query.
3.	Request some other devices similar to a selected item (same company).
